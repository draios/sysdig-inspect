# Development

## Continuous builds

At this time, Sysdig Inspect uses Jenkins to run the build every time a commit is pushed on any branch.

At any time, you can download the latest build available on a given branch from:

- MAC application: https://download.sysdig.com/dev/sysdig-inspect/branch-name/app/mac/Sysdig+Inspect-darwin-x64.zip
- Linux installer (RPM): https://download.sysdig.com/dev/sysdig-inspect/branch-name/installers/linux/sysdig-inspect-0.1.44.x86_64.rpm
- Linux installer (DEB): https://download.sysdig.com/dev/sysdig-inspect/branch-name/installers/linux/sysdig-inspect_0.1.44_amd64.deb

where `branch-name` is the name of the branch with the changes (e.g. `dev`).
